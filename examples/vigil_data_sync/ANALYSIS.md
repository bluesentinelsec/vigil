# VigilDataSync — FFI Module Stress Test & Critical Analysis

## 1. Architecture

```

The program exercises the FFI module (`ffi` + `unsafe`) through:
- **10 safety/edge-case tests**: null pointers, bounds checking, double-free, use-after-free, errno, sizeof, callbacks, large buffers, peek/poke types, C malloc/free
- **5 performance benchmarks**: FFI sin() calls, buffer alloc/free, string roundtrips, peek/poke, C malloc/free
- **Data pipeline**: JSON generation, byte-level parsing via unsafe, gzip compression round-trip

## 3. Critical Analysis & Roadmap

### Production Readiness Score: 4/10

The FFI module is a functional prototype that can call simple C functions, but it is far from production-ready for real-world C library integration.

### What Works Well (Strengths)

1. **Managed buffers are safe**: `unsafe.alloc/free/get/set` provides bounds-checked memory with slot invalidation on free. Out-of-bounds and use-after-free are caught at runtime. This is genuinely better than raw C.

2. **Signature-based binding is clever**: `ffi.bind(lib, "sin", "f64(f64)")` is a clean API for simple functions. No header files needed.

3. **Type coverage is adequate for primitives**: i32, i64, u8, u32, f32, f64, ptr, void, string — covers most C function signatures.

4. **peek/poke API is complete**: All primitive types can be read/written at arbitrary offsets. This enables struct field access.

5. **Performance is reasonable**: ~1.7M FFI sin() calls/sec, ~5.9M peek/poke ops/sec. The libffi overhead is acceptable for most use cases.

6. **Callback trampoline pool exists**: 8 callback slots with dispatch function. The mechanism works.

### Critical Weaknesses

#### W1: No struct mapping (BLOCKER)
There is no way to define C struct layouts in Vigil. To access `sqlite3_stmt`, `curl_easy`, `z_stream`, or `cJSON` objects, you must manually calculate byte offsets using `unsafe.sizeof`/`unsafe.offsetof` and `peek/poke`. This is:
- Error-prone (wrong offsets = silent corruption)
- Unreadable (magic numbers everywhere)
- Unmaintainable (changes if struct layout changes)

**Needed**: `extern struct` declarations or a struct layout DSL.

#### W2: No callback-to-Vigil bridge (BLOCKER)
`unsafe.cb_alloc()` returns a C function pointer, but there is **no way from Vigil code to register a Vigil closure as the callback target**. The dispatch function must be set from C via `vigil_ffi_callback_set_dispatch()`. This means:
- curl progress callbacks: impossible from Vigil
- SQLite custom functions: impossible from Vigil
- Any C API requiring callbacks: impossible from Vigil

**Needed**: `ffi.callback(fn_type, vigil_closure) -> i64` that returns a C function pointer.

#### W3: ffi.call is limited to 6 i64 args (SEVERE)
`ffi.call(handle, a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5)` takes exactly 7 parameters (handle + 6 args). All args are i64. This means:
- Can't pass more than 6 arguments
- Can't mix i64 and f64 in the same call (must use `call_f` which only takes 2 f64 args)
- Can't pass strings directly (must convert to pointer first)

**Needed**: Variadic `ffi.call` or a builder pattern: `ffi.call(h).arg_i64(x).arg_f64(y).arg_ptr(z).invoke()`

#### W4: No error recovery (SEVERE)
FFI errors (invalid handle, dlopen failure) propagate as fatal runtime errors. There is no `try/catch` or `guard` mechanism to handle them gracefully. This means:
- Can't probe for optional libraries
- Can't handle partial failures
- Can't write robust wrappers

**Needed**: Error return values or integration with Vigil's `err` type.

#### W5: No `extern "C"` declarations (MODERATE)
There is no way to declare C function signatures at the type level. Everything is stringly-typed via signature strings like `"i32(i32,i32)"`. The compiler cannot type-check FFI calls.

**Needed**: `extern fn malloc(i64) -> ptr;` declarations that the compiler can verify.

#### W6: No const/macro/enum support (MODERATE)
C libraries define hundreds of constants (`SQLITE_OK`, `CURLE_OK`, `Z_OK`). There is no way to import or define these. Users must hardcode magic numbers.

**Needed**: `extern const SQLITE_OK: i32 = 0;` or a constant import mechanism.

#### W7: Global mutable state for bindings (MODERATE)
`ffi.bind` uses a global array of 256 slots. This is:
- Not thread-safe
- Limited to 256 bound functions total across all libraries
- No way to unbind or reclaim slots

#### W8: ffi/unsafe modules not documented (MINOR)
`vigil doc ffi` and `vigil doc unsafe` return "not found". These are the most complex modules and need the most documentation.

### Bugs Found During This Exercise

1. **Compiler segfault with 5+ user module imports**: Importing 5 or more `.vigil` files from `lib/` causes a segfault. Workaround: consolidate into ≤4 files.

2. **Compiler segfault with `http.get` multi-return in check mode**: `vigil check` on a file using `i32 s, string b, string h = http.get(url)` segfaults.

3. **f-strings don't support escaped quotes**: `f"sizeof({\"i32\"})"` fails with "unterminated f-string interpolation". Must use variables.

4. **No JSON module**: Despite being a common need, there's no `json` stdlib module.

### Concrete Proposals (Priority Order)

1. **Add `extern struct` declarations** — Allow defining C struct layouts:
   ```vigil
   extern struct z_stream {
       ptr next_in;
       u32 avail_in;
       u64 total_in;
       ptr next_out;
       u32 avail_out;
       u64 total_out;
   }
   ```

2. **Add `ffi.callback(closure) -> i64`** — Bridge Vigil closures to C function pointers:
   ```vigil
   fn my_progress(i64 total, i64 now) -> i32 { return 0; }
   i64 cb_ptr = ffi.callback(my_progress);
   ```

3. **Make `ffi.call` variadic with mixed types** — Or add `ffi.call_mixed`:
   ```vigil
   ffi.call(h, i64(42), 3.14, ptr(buf));  // mixed arg types
   ```

4. **Add error recovery for FFI calls** — Return `(result, err)` tuples:
   ```vigil
   i64 lib, err e = ffi.open("libfoo.so");
   if (e) { fmt.println("library not found"); }
   ```

5. **Add `extern fn` declarations** — Type-safe FFI at compile time:
   ```vigil
   extern "C" fn sqlite3_open(string path, ptr db) -> i32;
   ```

6. **Add doc entries for ffi and unsafe modules** — These are critical for adoption.

7. **Fix the 5-module import segfault** — This blocks any non-trivial project.

### Summary

The FFI module provides a working foundation for calling simple C functions with primitive arguments. The `unsafe` module's managed buffers with bounds checking are a genuine safety improvement over raw C. However, the lack of struct mapping, callback bridging, and mixed-type variadic calls makes it impossible to bind any real-world C library (libcurl, sqlite3, zlib, cJSON) from pure Vigil code today. The module is suitable for calling leaf functions (sin, malloc, strlen) but not for integrating with complex C APIs that use structs, callbacks, or more than 6 arguments.
